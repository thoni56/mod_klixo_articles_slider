Many effects are available to animate the transition between each slide.</p> <p><strong>Version 1.3.6 :</strong> Corrections to PHP code for compliance with PHP strict standards.</p> <p><strong>Version 1.3.5 :</strong> Minor corrections to the code. Undefined variable would cause PHP notice on servers where display_errors = on and error_reporting = E_ALL. Note that these settings are normally not used on production servers.</p> <p><strong>Version 1.3.3 :</strong> Slidebar color now accepts transparent background. Added settings to choose the color of the numbers in the slidebar. All module CSS styles are now added to the head of the html document as per W3C guidelines</p> <p><strong>Version 1.3.2 :</strong> Compatibility Improvement to code</p> <p><strong>Version 1.3.1 :</strong> Bug corrected with transparent background that would display a black background instead.<br /> Use minified javaScript for faster loading. <br /> </p> <p><strong>Version 1.2.0 :</strong> Fixes possible compatibility issues with some extensions. Better CSS scaling when several slider modules are shown on the same page.</p> <div style='float:left; margin-right:8px'><a title='If you like Klixo Articles Slider, you can make a donation to support its development' target='_blank' href='https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=Y46HCQV8TER6S'> <img alt='If you like Klixo Articles Slider, you can make a donation to support its development' src='https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/SE/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif' border='0'></a></div><p>If you like Klixo Articles Slider, you can consider a small donation to support its future development.</p>"
